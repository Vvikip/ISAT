# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
I Saw A Thing (ISAT)

## Purpose
A challenge-based mobile app where groups compete to spot or experience specific things in the real world (e.g., "I saw a Tesla car"). Each group defines its own challenge. Members earn points by confirming they've seen or done the challenge item, tracked via a big red button in the app. A leaderboard keeps the competition engaging.

## Target Users
- Groups of friends, colleagues, or communities seeking fun, real-world challenges.
- Anyone interested in casual, social, or location-based competition.

## Core Features
- User authentication and group creation/joining.
- Group-specific challenge definition (e.g., "See a Tesla car").
- A prominent "big red button" for users to confirm when they've completed the challenge.
- Real-time leaderboard displaying group rankings and points.
- Group management (invite, remove, or leave group).
- Basic profile and point history.

## User Stories
- As a user, I can create a group and define a challenge for my friends.
- As a user, I can join an existing group via invite or code.
- As a user, I can see a big red button to confirm when I complete the challenge.
- As a user, I can view the leaderboard and see who has the most points.
- As a user, I can see my history of completed challenges.

## Success Criteria
- Users can create/join groups and define a challenge.
- Button presses are reliably tracked and reflected in real time on the leaderboard.
- The app is intuitive and engaging for group-based play.
- The challenge definition is flexible for different group interests.

## Out of Scope (for MVP)
- Automated verification of challenge completion (manual honor system for now).
- Complex challenge types (e.g., multi-step or location-based verification).

## Open Questions & Answers
- Should there be a way to reset or rotate challenges? **Not now, but maybe in the future.**
- Do we want to allow photo/video proof in the future? **Yes, in the future, but not now.**
- Should groups be public or private by default? **Private. There will be no public groups.**
